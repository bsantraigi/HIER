# Preprocessing Step

This folder contains the preprocessing steps 

The required files should be downloaded from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ajmLk43rkEtnkkime_7awxe09X3R6IBq/view?usp=sharing) and extracted here.

You can run create_delex_data.py to get the processed files in the ../data folder.
